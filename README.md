# updateFlash
This Python script will keep Flash Player up to date

This Python script will search the Adobe site for a new version of Adobe Flash and download that version.
Currently, as of 20151015 it will only download Mac DMG versions, I will later modify it to allow you to 
pass an argument that will grab other platforms like: Windows and Linux.
